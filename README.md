# Cumulus MX
**The Cumulus MX weather program**

This is the source code for the Cumulus MX weather program written by Steve Loft.

A note from Steve when he released the code:
>"*[the code is]* Offered completely without support in the hope that it might be useful. The code is very badly structured due to the 'Frankenstein' way it was cobbled together from various places. Some of it is a machine translation of parts of Cumulus 1."

In order to function correctly the program needs the supporting distribution files and folders. These can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/cumulusmx/CumulusMX-DistributionFiles)

The original source was post build b3043 - it incorporated some changes that were being worked on by Steve before he retired.

**The support forum for this software can [be found here](https://cumulus.hosiene.co.uk/)**

**Please use the support forum for reporting issues rather than GitHub**


The change log [is here](CHANGELOG.md)
